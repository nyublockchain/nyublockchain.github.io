The distinction between pull and push is well known to practitioners but has received relatively little attention in peer reviewed literature. They will then invite discussion of a further issue, only touched on in their paper, the role of pull initiation in the execution of smart contracts (arguably central, as illustrated by the DeFi ERC-20 token standard which supports smart contracts through pull initiation by code that has been validated on the Ethereum blockchain). Their paper suggests that a key requirement for pull initiation is the provision of supporting credit and liquidity protections to protect both sender and recipient from default risks. A point they hope this discussion can address is how to identify circumstances in which these protections can be provided through code alone (as when smart contracts operate on a permissionless blockchain); and distinguish these from other circumstances where these protections require the involvement of intermediaries (hence ruling out fully decentralised smart contract implementation).","tags":[],"title":"Payment initiation and smart contracts","type":"past_talks"},{"authors":["Hanna Halaburda","Jason Pearson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1728649800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1728649800,"objectID":"bf61657270a0385c286e5f9867fb6b73","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/past_talks/10-11/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/past_talks/10-11/","section":"past_talks","summary":"In this week session we discussed the development of Central Banks Digital Currencies, their usage, implementation and related topics.
