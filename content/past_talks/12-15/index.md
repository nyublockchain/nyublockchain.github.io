title: Blockchain Price vs.Quantity Controls

summary: "This paper proposes a new transaction fee mechanism for blockchain platforms like Ethereum. This paper is presented by Abdoulaye Ndiaye (NYU)"
abstract: "Blockchains, the technology underlying cryptocurrencies, face large fluctuations in user demand. These fluctuations necessitate effective transaction fee mechanisms to manage service allocation. This paper models the blockchain designerâ€™s choice between price control and quantity control. I first derive an analytical expression for the advantage of a minimum fee over a rigid block size limit. When demand uncertainty is high, price controls are preferred. A large price elasticity of demand for block space amplifies this advantage. Using these insights, I provide novel results on the dynamics of optimal transaction fee mechanisms within a class of simple mechanisms, including that of the Ethereum blockchain. Further, I study optimal mechanisms that are resistant to complete value extraction by monopolistic blockchain service providers, known as validators. Using Ethereum data, I estimate the parameters of the optimal transaction fee mechanism and offer recommendations for blockchain designers."
