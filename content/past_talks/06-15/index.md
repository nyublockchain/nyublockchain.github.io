title: Decentralized Platform Generativity

summary: This paper delves into the underexplored realm of decentralized platforms, such as blockchains, contrasting them with centralized counterparts in terms of their impact on innovation dynamics. It uncovers how transaction validators and platform design intricacies shape generativity and network effects, enriching our comprehension of developer engagement and network dynamics in decentralized environments. This paper is presented by Prof. Aija Leiponen (Cornell)

abstract: To date, the focus of research on platform generativity, or the ability of platforms to generate innovation, has been on centralized platforms. The emergent phenomenon of decentralized platforms-—also known as blockchains or distributed ledger technologies—have been much less studied, even though the notion of decentralization has been fundamental to the development of the internet. In this paper we investigate the features and dynamics that inspire developers to innovate by launching new applications on decentralized platforms. We find that, while decentralized platforms are similar to centralized platforms in their systems of interactions between the participants, particularly, users and developers, the new participants, transaction validators, shape platform generativity in unexpected ways. We also explore how the design of the decentralized platform influences the nature of the network effects. Our findings enhance our understanding of network effects and developer empowerment on decentralized platforms.
