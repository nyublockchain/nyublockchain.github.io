# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: In the context of digital platforms, the study examines the impact of allowing market-driven tradability of platform-specific digital tokens. It finds that such a policy leads to significant token value depreciation and a decrease in user engagement, with sellers becoming more conservative in their sales strategies. The research highlights the need for careful strategic management and oversight when devolving decision rights for digital tokens to maintain marketplace stability.
