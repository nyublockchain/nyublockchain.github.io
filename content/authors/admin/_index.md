<br>
The Blockchain Lab at NYU Stern is a research lab committed to pushing our frontier of knowledge in the blockchain and Web 3.0 space.

We research technology developments and economic forces that shape blockchain platforms to understand how blockchain technologies and Web 3.0 can bring transparency, inclusivity and democracy to the internet.

We study a broad range of research topics such as the tensions between decentralization and centralization, the tradeoffs in Layer 2 scaling solutions, and decentralized autonomous organizations. Our theoretical perspectives include platform competition, platform governance, platform policy, game theory, and mechanism design.

We regularly attend academic and practitioners’ conferences. If you are interested in chatting, please feel free to reach out.

We closely collaborate with related research groups across NYU, such as the <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/crg/">NYU Cryptography group at Courant</a>.
